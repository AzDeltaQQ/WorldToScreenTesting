navigation is shit dont even attempt to use it. this is a hobby project i was working on to mess around. can do some interesting stuff as far as world to screen goes. can add any picture to the game.. etc. 


my suggestion would be to remove tc folder completely. remake cmake file... and start over with the basics if u want to iterate on this project. otherwise its a throwaway project with some cool stuff.
